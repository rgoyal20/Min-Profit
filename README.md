## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Novelty
1) Applied the idea of predicting startup revenue from scratch for different investors using different Machine learning models
2) Perform data cleaning on the existing dataset.
3) Performed Hyperparameter adjustment.
4) Evaluated various models like decision tree,lasso,random forest and subsequently hyperparameters for the final model construction    used on the website.
5) Reduced the algorithm's double error without increasing the model's complexity.
