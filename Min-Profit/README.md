## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Novelty
1) Applied feature engineering to drop unwanted features, handle missing values, handle categorical features, handle feature scaling, remove outliers, explore the Correlation between numerical features, find relation between features and labels. This led to reduced mean squared error of the algorithm without increasing the complexity of the model.

2) Hyperparameter Tuning was performed. Grid search technique was used to select the best model among linear regression, lasso, and decision tree and subsequently the hyperparameters for the final model build which was used in the website.
